      <h1>How Do Solar-Powered Water Pumps Work?</h1>
      <p>
        Essentially, solar-powered water pumps work by converting the sun’s rays (photons) to electricity that will  operate the water pump. It uses solar panels to collect the photons (units of light) from sunlight, producing the direct current (DC) that provides the energy for the motor to pump water out from its source. An inverter is used if the pump motor needs alternating current (AC) rather than DC.
      </p>
      <h1>Benefits of Solar-Powered Water Pumps
      </h1>
      <p>
        Without solar-powered water pumps, many communities in developing countries need to rely on rainfall and inaccessible water sources. This lack of reliable water can limit harvesting to just twice each year.<br>
        People are also forced to get their energy from unclean, toxic fuels that harm the environment and community members. Farmers need to rely on labor-intensive ropes and buckets or expensive diesel or petrol-based water pumping systems to irrigate their crops.<br>
        Approximately three billion people worldwide rely on fuelwood for domestic energy. Charcoal that’s made from fuelwood powers their water pumps. The problems with fuelwood are scarcity and women and children (the ones primarily responsible for collecting the wood) having to walk further to collect the timber required for fuelwood.
