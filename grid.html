      <h1>Grid-Tied system</h1>
      <p>
        If you’ve been thinking about installing   grid-tied solar there are many reasons to get started today,including:
      </p>
      <p>
        • Saving Money<br>
        • Saving the Environment<br>
        • Increasing Property Value<br>
        • Standardizing or Eliminating Utility Bill<br>
        • Taking Advantage of Tax Credits and Incentives
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to achieve these universally appealing goals, you have a couple main options – installing either a grid-tied solar system or an off-grid solar system.MOXIE primarily installs grid-tied solar systems.
        We’re laser-focused saving money for customers and setting you up with a sound, long-term investment.
        Also, our in-house utility company liaisons have found that it is a bit more difficult for customers to get off-grid solar permitting approval when the option to tie into the grid is available.
        Luckily, there are numerous practical and financial benefits to having your solar system grid-tied and we’ve already helped thousands of solar customers take advantage of them.<br>
        Read on to learn all about grid-tied systems and the main advantages of having one installed for your home, business, or farm.

      <h1>What is a Grid-Tied Solar System?</h1>
      <p>
        First, let’s establish exactly what a grid-tied solar system is.
        The simplest definition of a grid-tied solar system is one that is connected to the electrical power grid. The system is reliant on this grid to produce usable solar energy and funnel excess energy for net metering, clean energy credits, or later usage.
        It may seem counterintuitive to install a solar power system that is reliant on the same energy grid you’re trying to get away from, however, once you understand the facts of how a grid-tied solar system works and the benefits it provides over an off-grid system, it will make much more sense.
      </p>
      <h1>How Does Solar Work on the Grid?</h1><br>
      <p>
        One of the questions we get a lot is, well, where do the batteries go? In a modern system, most of the time there aren’t any. The way that is works: you’ve got your sun, you’ve got your house, and you’ve got your solar. Couple pieces of equipment that make this whole thing work: you’ve got an inverter, you’ve got your meter, and you have the electrical grid. So the suns going to hit the panels and create direct current electricity. That direct current is going to run to an inverter. The inverter switches it from DC to AC (alternating current) which is what we use in our house.
        When you’re producing more power than you’re able to use, that excess is going to get flushed out through the grid and it’s going to be stored there as a form of kilowatt hour bank, an electricity savings account if you will.
        When you’re not producing as much as you’re using, during the night or in the middle of winter, you’re going to pull from the grid again. Our goal is to get you to a point where the energy that’s going out equals the cost of the energy that’s coming in, and thus, zero’s out your energy bill.

      <h1>Are There Any Drawbacks to Grid Connection?
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are some potential limitations to consider when installing grid-tied solar.
        1. If the main power grid happens to go down, your grid-tied system will shut off in order to prevent energy from feeding into the system and potentially harming utility workers (note: adding a backup battery to your grid-tied system will allow you to still have power in these situations, see next paragraph).
        2. Installing grid-tied solar may not be feasible in remote or undeveloped areas without nearby power lines.
