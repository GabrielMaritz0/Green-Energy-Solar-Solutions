      <h1>Off-grid - what is it, and what does it mean for homeowners?
      </h1>
      <p>
        An off-grid solar system is a solar installation that isn't connected to the utility grid. This means you have to rely on your solar panels to generate all your power, all the time.
        With an off-grid system, solar batteries are necessary for storing energy. It’s also smart to budget for a backup generator for extended periods of bad weather in case solar battery storage runs out.
      </p>
      <h1>Considering going off the grid? Here are  some of the benefits:
      </h1>
      <p>
        1. You’ll have complete energy independence. No grid connection means freeing yourself from the risk of power outages or fluctuating power costs. As you’re a producer of your own power you get a great amount of freedom... as long as your energy needs are low.<br>
        2. It can be the most eco-friendly and sustainable home energy setup. Without the grid, you can minimise your carbon footprint. Your system won’t contribute to water pollution and greenhouse gases (except rarely, when you might depend on a generator).
      </p>
      <h1>Here are some of the cons of going off-grid:
      </h1>
      <p>
        1. There’s no ‘security’ from using the grid as backup. You can’t rely on grid power during bad weather or if your system needs servicing.<br>
        2. You’ll need more panels and a large capacity batteries if you intend to power an entire home. Batteries and generators are important to have, but they represent higher initial costs. Batteries have limited lifespans and can require maintenance, so those expenses factor in as well.<br>
        3. You’ll have to tightly monitor your energy usage and lifestyle. With off-grid solar, you must use power sparingly. This might require big lifestyle changes, such as using most of your power in the daytime or tightly restricting night-time activities.<br>
        Both off-grid and hybrid systems are great ways go solar, but the right choice depends on your unique situation. Clearly, there are many details to consider... which is a lot to handle while you’re busy building your dream home. 
        To make it easier, talk to a solar expert who can help you navigate all the issues involved. It’s the most effective way to learn whether off-grid or hybrid solar is best for you.
